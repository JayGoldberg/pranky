# pranky
A set of scripts and ideas to prank your coworkers when they leave their workstations unlocked.

We try to be nice, all of the work done here should be easily reversible.

## Ideas

### Desktop background

- Take the current one and warp it somehow
- Set a new one
 - using random internets and such
- Subtle motion?

### Command Aliases

- make `cat` also play a cat noise
- alias vim to emacs or vice versa (set $EDITOR?)


### X session

- flip/invert the screen using randr
- Warp the mouse randomly
- launch naggy dialogs (`zenity`, `xdialog`)

### Real-world influence

- eject the cd drive randomly
- audible tune play under certain conditions using the PC speaker (use `beep`)
 - upon cdrom ejection
 - when a new shell is spawned
- ejecting the cdrom drive

### Common Operator tasks

Here is a list of tasks to help brainstorm ideas
- cat a file
- list a directory
- open a new tab in a browser
- use the mouse
- launch vim
- copy and paste things
